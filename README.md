# FMWF
Custom oscillator for Korg NTS-1 featuring a variable waveform from saw to triangle to reverse saw, a wavefolder, frequency modulation and full pitch control.

Knob A - Fm depth
Knob B - Wavefold amount

Custom Parameters:
1 - Carrier Oscillator pitch control: Octaves up/down
2 - Carrier Oscillator pitch control: Semitones up/down
3 - Cents up
4 - waveform mix control (0 is saw wave, 50 is triangle, 100 is a reversed saw wave)
5 - modulator Oscillator pitch control: semitones up
6 - modulator Oscillator pitch control: cents up

Note: code needs clean up and some optimisation as it is fairly cpu heavy. This is my first coding project though so that will have to be a task for the future when I know what I'm doing
