# FMWF
Custom oscillator for Korg NTS-1 with full pitch control variable waveform from saw to triangle to reverse saw, wavefolder, and frequency modulation.

Controls:
Knob A - FM depth
Knob B - Wavefold amount
Custom Parameters
1 octave - carrier oscillator pitch control: octave up/down
2 semitone - carrier oscillator pitch control: semitone up/down
3 cent - carrier oscillator pitch control: cent up
4 wave - carrier oscillator wave mix control (0 saw, 50 triangle, 100 reverse saw)
5 fm semi - modulator oscillator pitch control: semitone up
6 fm cent - modulator oscillator pitch control: cent up

Note: This is my first bit of code, so it probably needs some tidying up and optimising.
