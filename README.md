# FMWF
Custom oscillator for Korg NTS-1 with full pitch control variable waveform from saw to triangle to reverse saw, wavefolder, and frequency modulation.


Controls:

Knob A - FM depth.

Knob B - Wavefold amount

Custom Parameters

octave - carrier oscillator pitch control: octave up/down

semitone - carrier oscillator pitch control: semitone up/down

cent - carrier oscillator pitch control: cent up

wave - carrier oscillator wave mix control (0 saw, 50 triangle, 100 reverse saw)

fm semi - modulator oscillator pitch control: semitone up

fm cent - modulator oscillator pitch control: cent up


Note: This is my first bit of code, so it probably needs some tidying up and optimising.
